## Hi there 👋 Greetings from M&R Capital!

## About us
Michael Song and Richard Li are currently undergraduate students at the Engineering School of Southern Univerisity of Science and Technology. Inspired by great investor Ray Dalio, Michael and Richard decide to use computers to assist them in their trading strategies and to manage real assets one day in the future. They give their organization a name, M&R Capital Management. Of course, since Michael and Richard are still poor students, they are now managing a shared paper account.

## Echo, a trading bot
Echo is a super-intelligent hero in the game of Overwatch. As Overwatch Official described, "Echo is an evolutionary robot programmed with a rapidly adapting artificial intelligence, versatile enough to fill multiple battlefield combat roles." Since Michael and Richard are both super fans of Blizzard and Overwatch, they give their trading infrastructure a lovely name, Echo. Echo will make buying and selling decisions based on market changes and trading strategies in this project. Michael and Richard will open-source Echo's source code for learning and communication purposes.
It is also worth mentioning that Michael is an Echo one-trick player, which he successfully reached silver rank by playing Echo in Season 32.
